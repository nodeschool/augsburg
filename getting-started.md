## 🖥 Install Node

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is the core technology needed to start the NodeSchool workshops.

First up let's install node!

### 🏁 Windows

You can [download](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.15.3/node-v10.15.3-x86.msi) the offical installer from the [nodejs website](https://nodejs.org/).

Open the installer via a double-click and follow the installation process.

After the installation, open a console or Powershell and type

```bash
node -v
```

It should print something like

```bash
v10.15.3
```

🎉 **Congratulations! You have successfully installed node and are ready to go!** 🎉

### 🍏 macOS

You can [download](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.15.3/node-v10.15.3.pkg) the official
installer from the [nodejs website](https://nodejs.org/).

After the download just open the installer via a double-click and follow the installation process.

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed you can install node via

```bash
brew install node
```

After the installation, open a terminal and type

```bash
node -v
```

It should print something like

```bash
v10.15.3
```

🎉 **Congratulations! You have successfully installed node and are ready to go!** 🎉

### 🐧 Linux

The easiest way to use node on linux is via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To install nvm open a terminal and type

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

After running the install script, if you get `nvm: command not found` or see no feedback from your terminal after you type

```bash
command -v nvm
```

simply close your current terminal, open a new terminal, and try verifying again.

To install the latest lts version of node type

```bash
nvm install lts/dubnium
```

Check if node is installed via

```bash
node -v
```

It should print something like

```bash
v10.15.3
```

🎉 **Congratulations! You have successfully installed node and are ready to go!** 🎉

## 📝 Choose An Editor

The code editor is one of the most important things for a professional developer.
Depending on your needs, you can choose between different free options.

### Atom

[Atom](<https://atom.io/>) is a hackable text editor for the 21st Century. It is developed by [GitHub](<https://github.com/>) and completly open source. Like [Visual Studio Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>) , [Atom](<https://atom.io/>) is based on Electron, a framework for cross-platform desktop apps. You can download [Atom](<https://atom.io/>) for [Windows](https://atom.io/download/windows), [macOS](https://atom.io/download/mac) and [Linux](https://atom.io/download/linux) for free.

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>) ( also called vscode) is a free text editor developed by Microsoft. Like [Atom](<https://atom.io/>) it is also based on Electron to enable a cross-platform experience. [Visual Studio Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>) comes with some built-in functionalities like syntax highlighting, debugging, version control or auto completion. Today vscode is one of the most used editor by web developers. You can download [Visual Studio Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>) for [Windows](<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win32user>), [macOS](<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx>) and [Linux](<https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads>).

### Vim

Vim is a improved version of the original VI and a free terminal based text editor. Vim was ported to many operation systems like Linux, Windows, BSD, ... and is also shipped with every copy of macOS. Despite the availabilty in most of the operating systems, we would only encourage advanced users to using vim in NodeSchool.

### Other Alternatives

There are a lot of IDEs and text editors we haven't talked about. [Sublime Text](<https://www.sublimetext.com/>), [WebStorm](<https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/>), [Visual Studio](<https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>), ... and many more. Despite their greatness, most of them aren't available for free ☹️, but if you already have a copy and are used to them, feel free to use it!
